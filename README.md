# GPT3 mini GUI
A tiny Python streamlit app based on freeGPT 
<br>
<br>
freeGPT package does all the heavy lifting. 
<br>
streamlit does everything else, query the user, and display results.
<br>
<br>
Done for the heck of it, should not be used in production.
<br>
Has been made to be small on purpose for Python demonstration puropses.
<br>
Mostly trying to do it in the least lines of code.
<br>
<br>
*Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`*
<br>
*then enter `streamlit run chat3gui.py` to run*
<br>
<br>
`run.bat` is included with both steps in Windows
<br>
