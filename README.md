# GPT3 mini GUI
A Python streamlit app based on freeGPT
<br>
Done for the heck of it, should not be used in production.
<br>
Mostly trying to do it in the least lines of code.
<br>
*install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`*
*then enter `streamlit run chat3gui.py` to run*
A run.bat is included with both steps in Windows
